File/Locate version 0.61
========================

File::Locate is a direct port of the GNU locate command. As of now, you can
query an existing locate-db in a very similar way to locate(1L). The module
can also deal with the more recent slocate-format.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

When using suncc under Solaris, you probably have to do

   perl Makefile.PL CCFLAGS=-Xa

in order to put ucbcc into ANSI mode.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:
    
    Test::More

An existing locate-db wont hurt, too. ;-) You can create one manually if 
you have the frcode program:

  find / | frcode > locatedb

PLATFORMS

Tested on Perl5.005_03, Perl5.8.4 and 5.6.1 under Linux (gcc3.2) and with Perl5.005_03 
and various BSDs. 0.60 and later (unlike 0.01) not tested on Solaris.
