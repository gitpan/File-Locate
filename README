File/Locate version 0.01
========================

File::Locate is a direct port of the GNU locate command. As of now, you can
query an existing locate-db in a very similar way to locate(1L).

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

When using suncc under Solaris, you probably have to do

   perl Makefile.PL CCFLAGS=-Xa

in order to put ucbcc into ANSI mode.

Makefile.PL doesn't yet run without user-intervention. You'll be prompted
for the default location of your locate-db file. Before that, Makefile.PL
tries to find this path by looking at the locate-binary on your system.

If you have a working which(1) and strings(1) it will usually find something
but this is probably not guaranteed to be the correct value therefore it asks
before processing. Note that the module will also work if it can't determine
a default locate-db or you give it a bogus one.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  None save for a working C-compiler.

An existing locate-db wont hurt, too. ;-) You can create one manually if 
you have the frcode program:

  find / | frcode > locatedb

PLATFORMS

Tested on Perl5.8.0 and 5.6.1 under Linux (gcc3.2) and with Perl5.005_03 
under SUN Solaris (both Sun WorkShop 6 update 1 C 5.2 2000/09/11 and
gcc2.95.3).
